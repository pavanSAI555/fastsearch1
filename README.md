Interview Question

Step 1 : A Transaction model has been created with price, date , reward points as attributes.
Step 2 : Created a transaction list for adding new transactions, finding reward points for the previous three months, and calculating reward points for the current month.
Step 3 :The customer earns one point for every dollar they spend on the transaction that is over $50.The customer also gains another point for every dollar they spend over $100.
For instance, a customer who spends $120 gets 50 * 1 + (120 - 100) x 2 = 90 points.
As a result, the function CalcRewards now has the necessary logic.
